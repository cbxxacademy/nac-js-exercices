// Exercise 1
// Declare two variables, 'isMorning' with the value 'true' and 'isWeekday' with the value 'false'.
// Use the logical AND operator '&&' to check if it is both morning and a weekday. Store the result in a variable named 'isWorkingDay'.

// Your code here
let variableName1 = booleanValue
let variableName2 = booleanValue
let variableName3 = isMorning && isWeekday

console.log(isWorkingDay);
// Expected Output: false




// In the terminal, copy & paste the code below and run it to see the result in the console.
