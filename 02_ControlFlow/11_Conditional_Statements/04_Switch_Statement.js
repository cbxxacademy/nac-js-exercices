// Exercise 4
// Declare a variable 'dayOfWeek' with the value 'Wednesday'.
// Use a switch statement to log 'It's the middle of the week' if it is Wednesday,
// 'It's the start of the week' if it is Monday, and 'It's almost the weekend' if it is Friday.

// Your code here
let variableName = stringValue

switch (dayOfWeek) {
  case 'Monday':
    console.log('It\'s the start of the week');
    break;
  case 'Wednesday':
    console.log('It\'s the middle of the week');
    break;
  case 'Friday':
    console.log('It\'s almost the weekend');
    break;
  default:
    console.log('It\'s a regular day');
}
// Expected Output: It's the middle of the week
